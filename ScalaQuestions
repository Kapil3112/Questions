Pattern Matching:- 
Try understanding below code, it covers most of the questions asked on pattern matching. It matches multiple type of patterns

def echoWhatYouGaveMe(x: Any): String = x match {
// constant patterns
case 0 => "zero"
case true => "true"
case "hello" => "you said 'hello'"
case Nil => "an empty List"
// sequence patterns
case List(0, _, _) => "a three-element list with 0 as the first element"
case List(1, _*) => "a list beginning with 1, having any number of elements"
case Vector(1, _*) => "a vector starting with 1, having any number of elements"
// tuples
case (a, b) => s"got $a and $b"
case (a, b, c) => s"got $a, $b, and $c"
// constructor patterns
case Person(first, "Alexander") => s"found an Alexander, first name = $first"
case Dog("Suka") => "found a dog named Suka"
// typed patterns
case s: String => s"you gave me this string: $s"
case i: Int => s"thanks for the int: $i"
case f: Float => s"thanks for the float: $f"
case a: Array[Int] => s"an array of int: ${a.mkString(",")}"
case as: Array[String] => s"an array of strings: ${as.mkString(",")}"
case d: Dog => s"dog: ${d.name}"
case list: List[_] => s"thanks for the List: $list"
case m: Map[_, _] => m.toString
// the default wildcard pattern
case _ => "Unknown"
}

How to match multiple values in one case.
Solution:
Place the match conditions that invoke the same business logic on one line, separated by the | (pipe) character:
val i = 5
i match {
case 1 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 9 => println("odd")
case 2 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 10 => println("even")
}

Constructors:
Write a class with all varieties of constructor possible in scala class.
How to define a primary constructor.

Case Class:
What is case class in scala and why we need it.
Can we have mutable members in case class.
Benefits of case class.
Can we mutate case class object?
How case class objects are compared.
Can a case class extends another case class.
