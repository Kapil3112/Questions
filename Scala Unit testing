Aggregated reports for multi-module projects
There is no separate mojo for aggregated reports, there is aggregate parameter. 
To additionally generate aggregated SCoverage report for root module, when generating regular reports, set aggregate parameter value to true.
It works only in multimodule projects.

<configuration>
     <aggregate>true</aggregate>
</configuration>
